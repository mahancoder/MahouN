"""
MAHOUN Runtime Profile
======================
Descriptive runtime profile for transparency and logging.

This module provides a READ-ONLY view of the current operational profile.
It does NOT control behavior - it simply reports what mode the system is in.

The profile matches the current demo behavior and is used for:
- Logging/transparency in demo output
- Test validation
- Documentation

DO NOT use this for control flow decisions. Use core.runtime_config for that.
