MAHOUN Governance Violations
=============================

Classification: CRITICAL / SHARED GOVERNANCE MODEL
Purpose: Unified violation model used by both Runtime and Lifecycle governance layers.

All governance violations — runtime and CI — use these types. No ad hoc
violation dicts or untyped error strings are allowed.
