"""
MAHOUN Governed Ingestion Runtime
=================================

Classification: KERNEL / INGESTION AUTHORITY

This is the governance-native replacement for the deprecated UnifiedLoader.
It eliminates orchestration-era middleware, retry-driven nondeterminism, and DLQ state corruption.

Core Principles:
1. Governance BEFORE orchestration
2. Determinism BEFORE retries
3. Immutable lineage BEFORE rollback
4. Append-only semantics (no DETACH DELETE compensation)
5. Capability-scoped execution (isolated per invocation)

    Capability-Scoped Execution Runtime for Document Ingestion.

    Unlike UnifiedLoader:
    - No background worker queues (avoids async authority leakage).
    - No DLQ (fails closed deterministically).
    - No retries (execution is deterministic; if it fails, the input is invalid or state is constrained).
    - No destructive rollbacks (relies on atomic GovernedWriteTransaction to naturally revert on exception).
