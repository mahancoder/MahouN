MAHOUN Governance Kernel
========================

Classification: CRITICAL PLATFORM GOVERNANCE / NON-BYPASSABLE
Purpose: Unified enforcement model for Runtime and Lifecycle governance.

This package is the single governance kernel for MAHOUN. All governance
enforcement — runtime and CI/CD — flows through this module.

Layers:
    Runtime Governance:
        ValidatorPipeline, ProvenanceTracker, OntologyEnforcer,
        DeterministicResolver, GovernanceContext

    Lifecycle Governance (CI/CD):
        ForbiddenPatternScanner, ArchitectureComplianceChecker,
        SchemaDriftDetector, CoverageEnforcer

Shared:
    GovernanceViolation, GovernancePolicy, ViolationSeverity

Author: MAHOUN Platform Governance Council
Version: 1.0.0
